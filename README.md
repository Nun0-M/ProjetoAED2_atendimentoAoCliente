This project is about a program that reads a list of "clients" from a .txt file and stores the clients as a listed link. Then the user must select the amount of employees he wants to simulate and the simulation starts.
The clients are assigned by speciality and priority .
When the call is over the attendant must select another client if any is available.

This project was made for my University Algorithms and Data Structures class and is functional as of 29/04/2024
